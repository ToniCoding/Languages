A set of bash scripts I've been developing over my learning through it.

### Scripts and their functions so far (as 01/02/23)
- aptsnapupdate: Simple menu menu that upgrade apt and snap repositories. The special thing about this script is that allows the user upgrading both apt and snap repositorioes at the same time. Created, developed and tested: 31/02/23. Tested on Ubuntu 22.04 distro.
